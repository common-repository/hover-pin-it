Adds a Pinterest "Pin It" button to images on your site, with eye catching hover effects.

== Description ==

Adds a Pinterest "Pin It" button to images on your site, with eye catching hover effects.

Hover Pin-It allows you to customize:

* Position of the Pinterest button
* Style of the Pinterest button
* Whether Pinterest button appears on posts, pages, the home page, or any combination of the three
* Whether to include the pin count
* The smallest image size a Pinterest button should be placed on (useful to stop the button from appearing on thumbnails)
* Choose the page title or the image alt text as the pin description
